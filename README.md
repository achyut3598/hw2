# Cloud Computing - hw2

To create and run a docker image using this repo, use powershell in admin mode, navigate to this directory and run the following commands:

* docker build -t hw2 .
* docker run hw2

Here's a link to the image I created. It's a tar file. The file size is 155 MB which is why I could not upload it to Github.
